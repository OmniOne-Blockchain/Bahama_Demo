# Bahamas Demo. Overview



#### Introduction

OmniOne aims to create a world of mutual trust.

Assuming that a trust infrastructure is built based on blockchain and DID, issuer can issue a trustworthy Verifiable Claim to user via OmniOne.

The more OmniOne verification is used by users in their daily life, the more they will be rewarded through the OmniOne platform with OMN tokens, and the more they will receive social and economic benefits.

Through the demo, we want to show how Eliot, a Korean user traveling to Bahamas, can perform easily and securely to the identification process of the Bahamas service provider. In addition, the demo will show that users will be able to use OmniOne as a means of payment.

From the moment you enter the Bahamas to the time you return to your home country, you can see the economic benefits of a visitor through this demo.



#### Scenario 1 : Online Mall

Scenario 1 describes how OmniOne can facilitate access to online services (such as online shopping mall) through the use of user's Verifiable Claim. It also shows how OmniOne provides a secure payment solution with OMN token stored in the blockchain through signature using DID. Below is a more detailed description of the demo.

Eliot, a tourist visiting Bahamas, submits his passport to the Bahamas Immigration Service. The personal information of visitor's passport are stored as digital information in the Bahamas relevant agency. Then, the information will be implemented in the Bahamas’ database so that users can obtain digital identification cards for Bahamas visitors.

Upon arrival in Bahamas and by following instructions from Bahamas tour guides, Eliot will be able to install the OmniOne app and receive a digital ID card for visitors through the app. In addition, 10,000 OMN will be paid as reward for the issuance.

Tour guides provide links of online malls, which are available to visitors.

After accessing the online shopping mall, Eliot can easily sign in to the shopping mall through a digital ID card for visitors granted through the OmniOne app without having to perform to any additional onboarding process. (Verifiable Claim)

In the demo, the shopping mall will propose multiple tour packages offered by the Bahamas and the prices are expressed in OMN units. If you select an item and follow the payment instructions, the payment will be completed using your OMN tokens balance (initially equal to 10,000 OMN, which corresponds to the reward for the initial issuance) and paid through the OmniOne app. You will be able to check your transaction history by clicking on 'My OmniOne' in the app.

#### Scenario 2 : Offline Shop

Scenario 2 describes how users of OmniOne can perform to an offline verification. For doing so, OmniOne’s users need to scan the QR code of the offline store with the OmniOne app. Within the QR code, the store’s DID information and prices are shown for the services the OmniOne’s users want to use in the store.

OmniOne’s users check the information and amount of the other party in the app and signs it electronically through biometric authentication. Eventually, users can check in 'my OmniOne' whether the token has been deducted or not.

The store uses the relevant webpage to verify that the user has performed to the payment.
